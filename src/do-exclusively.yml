  This is a simple helper script to ensure that a certain action happens once at a time on a CircleCI project.
  It is a higher-order command like sudo, so you can wrap whatever other commands you want with it.
  This orb is inspired by https://github.com/bellkev/circle-lock-test
  Orb repo: https://github.com/miyajan/do-exclusively-orb

commands:
  do-exclusively:
    description: |
      Run command exclusively.
      This depends on jq.

      command:
        description: |
          Command executed exclusively.
        type: string
      token:
        description: |
          The env var containing CircleCI API token that can read builds for the project (either a user or project API token will work).
          Pass this as a literal string such as `$CIRCLE_TOKEN`.
          Do not paste the actual token into your configuration.
